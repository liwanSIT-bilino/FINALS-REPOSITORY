        ====================================================== -->
        <h2>4. Besao</h2>

        <h3>Tayaw di Besao</h3>
        <p>
            a traditional community dance performed by the Kankanaey people to celebrate important events such as weddings, thanksgiving rituals, victory feasts, community gatherings, and other major occasions. In Besao, the Tayaw is more than just a performance — it is a symbol of unity, cultural identity, and joy. The dance is typically led by respected community members called mumbaki or elders, who move gracefully in a circular or forward backward pattern while following the rhythm of gongs (gangsa). Participants join in naturally, forming lines or circles that represent equality, harmony, and togetherness within the community.
        </p>

        <p>
            the Kachangyan (sometimes spelled kachagyan or kachang-yan) is a traditional Kankanaey victory and celebration dance performed during important community events such as weddings, thanksgiving feasts (begnas), canaos, and other major gatherings. Unlike the Ifugao “Kachangyan,” which is mainly a wedding dance, the Besao version is rooted in Kankanaey culture, symbolizing joy, unity, and the public honoring of esteemed individuals or families.

The dance is usually led by respected elders or community members, who step gracefully in a proud, steady rhythm while following the beat of the gangsa (flat gongs). The movement is simple yet dignified—slow stepping forward and backward, swaying gently, and maintaining a poised and respectful posture. As the gongs continue, more people join the circle or line, showing community solidarity and shared happiness for the occasion.
