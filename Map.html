    <h2>About the Location</h2>
    <p>
        Mountain Province is located at the heart of the Cordillera Administrative Region in Northern Luzon, Philippines. 
        It is known for its rugged mountain ranges, cool climate, and scenic rice terraces carved into steep slopes. 
        The province’s terrain is shaped by river valleys, limestone formations, and highland forests that support local agriculture and biodiversity. 
        Bontoc, the capital, lies at the convergence of major roads that connect the different municipalities. 
        Its elevated landscape helps preserve indigenous traditions, making Mountain Province one of the most culturally rich areas in the region.

    <h2>Province Boundaries</h2>
    <p>
        Mountain Province is surrounded by several culturally and geographically distinct provinces. 
        It is bordered by Benguet to the southwest and Ifugao to the southeast.  
        To the north lies the province of Kalinga, while Ilocos Sur borders its western side.  
        These surrounding areas contribute to Mountain Province’s connectivity while maintaining its remote and independent cultural identity.  
        The province’s central mountain location also makes it a natural travel corridor within the Cordillera range.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Get to Mountain Province</h2>
    <p>
        Travelers commonly reach Mountain Province via Baguio City through the Halsema Highway, one of the highest highways in the Philippines.  
        Another popular route is the Banaue–Ifugao road, which passes through scenic highlands and rice terrace areas.  
        Public buses and vans regularly operate from Manila, Baguio, Banaue, and Santiago City going to Bontoc, the capital.  
        Because there is no airport within the province, all travel is done through land transportation.  
        Travel times can vary due to weather conditions, particularly during the rainy season when mountain roads may become challenging.
    </p>

    <h2>Geographical Features</h2>
    <p>
        Mountain Province has a total land area of approximately 2,157 square kilometers, making it one of the larger provinces in the Cordillera.  
        It is characterized by rugged mountain terrain, river valleys, and steep cliffs shaped by centuries of natural erosion.  
        The Chico, Aguid, and Tanudan rivers flow across the province, supporting irrigation and agriculture.  
        The climate is predominantly cool due to high elevation, creating ideal conditions for growing temperate crops such as coffee and root vegetables.  
        The province is also known for its limestone formations, caves, and pine forests, all of which contribute to its breathtaking landscape.
