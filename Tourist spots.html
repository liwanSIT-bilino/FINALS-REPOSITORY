    <h1>Major Tourist Spots in Mountain Province</h1>

    <!-- 1. BARLIG -->
    <section id="barlig">
        <h2>Barlig</h2>

        <img src="images/Mount amuyao.jpg" class="spot-img" style="height: 600px;">
        <p><strong>Mt. Amuyao</strong> – Mount Amuyao is one of the highest and most important mountains in the Cordillera region. It rises 2,702 meters above sea level and is located between Barlig in Mountain Province and Banaue in Ifugao. Because of its height, it has a very cold climate, thick fog, and forests covered in moss.

What makes Mount Amuyao special is its unique environment and cultural surroundings. The mountain is home to mossy forests, pine trees, and a rich variety of plants that only grow in high places. The air is fresh, and the views from the summit include wide landscapes, mountain ranges, and sometimes a sea of clouds, which many hikers love to witness during sunrise.</p>

        <img src="images/Lawi.jpg" class="spot-img" style="height: 600px;">
        <p><strong>Lawi</strong> – "LAWI" in Barlig, Mountain Province, likely refers to a local landmark or cultural element, possibly the Philippine Eagle Statue, symbolizing conservation and culture, or maybe a localized term (like a clan, spot, or tradition) within one of Barlig's 11 barangays, a municipality known for its Cordilleran culture and scenic beauty in the Cordillera Administrative Region of the Philippines. </p>

        <img src="images/Barlig Terrace.jpg" class="spot-img" style="height: 600px;">
        <p><strong>Barlig Rice Terraces</strong> – The Barlig Rice Terraces are one of the cultural and agricultural treasures of Mountain Province. Found in the municipality of Barlig, these terraces were carved by local ancestors into the mountain slopes using traditional tools and indigenous knowledge passed down through generations.

These terraces show how the Barlig people adapted to the steep terrain of the Cordillera. By cutting the mountains into step-like layers, they created flat fields where they could grow rice despite the rugged landscape. The terraces also help manage water by allowing it to flow gently from one level to another, which is important for maintaining healthy rice fields.

Barlig’s rice terraces are known for their mossy forests surrounding them, their cool mountain climate, and the peaceful, less-commercialized environment compared to more famous terraces in other provinces. Because Barlig is home to indigenous communities like Kadaclan and Fang-od, the terraces also reflect the people’s identity, traditions, and deep connection to their land.</p>
